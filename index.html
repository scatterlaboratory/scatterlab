          <h4 class="responsive-h4 px3 py2">We believe that when data is collected for the purpose of profit generation, without regard for human autonomy, society loses. Our human-centric decision-making and collection tools help organisations leverage their data for greater aims. We are working on three different projects that together help communities know and govern their data as well as the data products that flow from it:</h4>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Know your data</h3>
            <p class="">How do we decide about our data? At the moment we hardly know what data about us is out there, which makes it hard to make decisions about who should see it and when. We are working on a tool that helps individuals get a better sense of the personal, social and environmental data about them.</p>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Co-Data</h3>
            <p class="">A decision-making tool to individual community members decide what projects to allocate their data to. The tool allows members to propose their own projects and others to 'vote with their data'. Ideally, calculations are performed locally and only the results are dispatched to the project.</p>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">AI Governance</h3>
            <p class="">Who is in charge of the robots? When our data is used to make automated decisions for and about humans, we believe those same humans should be in control. This research project aims to explore how we can collectively govern the black boxes.</p>
