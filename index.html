          <h4 class="responsive-h4 px3 py2">Scatterlab facilitates the collective governance of data. We believe that when data is collected for the purpose of profit generation, without regard for human agency, society loses. Our human-centric decision-making and collection tools help organisations leverage their data for greater aims.</h4>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Collective Data Governance</h3>
            <p class="">Our data should be governed by all of us, together. In practice, that means we need the tools to make decisions about what data about us we collect and how we extract value from the data, for our collective benefit. To ensure true collective governance, we need to think about how we deal with knowledge and information assymetries. How we make sure the infrastructures we create are inclusive. And, how we make sure data about us will not be used against us. </p>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">AI Governance</h3>
            <p class="">Who is in charge of the robots? When our data is used to make automated decisions for and about humans, we believe those same humans should be in control. This research project aims to explore how we can collectively govern the black boxes. Who decides when they are turned on and off? How do we ensure the robots we build to make our organisations and communities better, do not end up harming members?</p>
